## Control questions
### 1. What is structural programming paradigm?

Structural programming is a software development and design methodology that focuses on maintaining a consistent and logical structure in the writing of programs. It proposes that simple control structures like sequence, selection, and iteration should be utilized instead of unstructured ones such as “goto” statements. The ultimate goal of structural programming is to enhance the quality, clarity, and efficiency of software development by ensuring that the control flow is simple, which translates to predictability.

### 2. What is procedural programming paradigm?

Procedural programming organizes code into procedures, which have better modularity, reusability, and maintainability. It uses clear control structures and calls procedures to perform certain tasks, being the principle paradigm where other high-level programming languages are formed. Procedural programming is still broadly practiced, and it is the base of other more complicated paradigms.
